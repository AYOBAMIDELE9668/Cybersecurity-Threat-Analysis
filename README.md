# Cybersecurity-Threat-Analysis
#This project is designed to analyze and predict cybersecurity threats using data science and machine learning techniques. It explores threat trends, identifies high-risk categories, and builds predictive models that can assist organizations in anticipating future risks.
## Objectives

 Load and clean cybersecurity threat data
 Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
 Visualize trends in threat types and severity
 Build predictive machine learning models
 Generate data-driven recommendations for proactive threat mitigation

## Technologies Used

 **Python**
 **Jupyter Notebook**
 **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data manipulation
 **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization
 **scikit-learn** for machine learning

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**
    Imported a structured CSV dataset
     Handled missing values and standardized categorical formats using `LabelEncoder`

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   Analyzed attack frequencies, severity levels, and sources
   Identified patterns in threat timing and distribution

3. **Data Visualization**
   Plotted trends using bar charts, pie charts, and line plots
    Visualized top threat types and peak attack periods

4. **Machine Learning Modeling**

   ### Models Implemented:

   **Random Forest Regressor**
   **Purpose**: Predict a continuous variable (e.g., threat score or frequency)
      **Steps**:
       - Features and targets were extracted from the cleaned dataset
       - The dataset was split into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`
       - The model was trained with `RandomForestRegressor`
       - Predictions were evaluated using `Mean Absolute Error (MAE)`
   
   **Random Forest Classifier** *(optional/experimental)*
     - **Purpose**: Classify categorical labels like threat type or severity
     - **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score using `classification_report`

   These models demonstrate how historical data can be leveraged to predict future threat behaviors and enhance situational awareness.

## Results

- Identified top threat categories dominating the dataset
- Uncovered critical time windows with peak cyber activity
- Demonstrated that machine learning can successfully predict future risks with interpretable metrics
- Provided actionable insights for cybersecurity teams to use in resource planning and incident prevention

## Recommendations Based on Trends Observed

1. **Strengthen Defenses Against Frequent Threats**
   - Prioritize protection against high-volume attack types like phishing and malware.

2. **Heighten Security During High-Risk Periods**
   - Increase system monitoring and alert sensitivity during weekends, holidays, or end-of-quarter windows.

3. **Automate Responses for High-Severity Threats**
   - Use real-time threat classification to automatically flag and escalate critical incidents.

4. **Implement Network Segmentation**
   - Isolate sensitive systems to prevent lateral movement during breaches.

5. **Incorporate Threat Intelligence Feeds**
   - Continuously update detection rules and filters with the latest global threat data.

6. **Predictive Monitoring**
   - Use machine learning outputs to anticipate threats before they occur and optimize defensive posture.

7. **Educate Staff Continuously**
   - Regular training, phishing simulations, and strict password policies can reduce human-error-related incidents.
